# Card-Operated Automatic Door System

This project involves an automated door system that operates using cards, allowing cards to be registered and deleted. When a request to enter is received, data from a PIR sensor is used to check if there is an object behind the door. If an object is detected, the door waits until the object passes before opening. Once open for a certain period, the door automatically closes. An IR sensor ensures that if an object attempts to pass through as the door is closing, it extends the open period briefly to allow safe passage.
